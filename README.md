# Ballistic-trajectory-assignment

This is a Python program that have set values from an old assignment on ballistic trajectory.
The set values are height, speed and angle aswell as the gravitational pull.

The program is on 19 lines of code that calculates how high, far and how long it was in the air. 
The calculation is made in a while loop that goes on while x less than 100 or y is less than or equal to 0.
For every loop it prints the calculated and or updated length, speed, heigth and time.
